      24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints
      “Task scheduled at” + DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on
      today’s date (only today).
    </h3>
    <p> <ol>
        <li> 1. First we need to figure out how to schedule it. Open the crontab by
        typing "crontab -e". I will use the date i wrote this (25th). That makes
        it */30 * 25 * *.</li> 
        <li> 2. Now we need to create the command itself. We start by
        echoing the string "Task scheduled at" and add the date after by $(date)</li>
        <li> Add everything together and you get the complete cronjob:</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <code>*/30 * 25 * * echo "Task scheduled at" $(date)</code>
    <h3>
      25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will
      display the answer of a question. The script should when started list a
      menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and
      which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display
      the answer of the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user
      should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should
      also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
      changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch
      case to be able to handle the menu. Each option in the menu should lead to
      an echo of the answer.
